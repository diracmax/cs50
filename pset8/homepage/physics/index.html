                    <p>Mechanics is a theory that shows that if we know the initial position, the initial velocity and the force, we can predict the motion of an object. It has been shown that objects obey Newton's equations of motion. Newton's equations of motion are very intuitive and have a beautiful form. Using this theory, it is possible to analyse the motion of objects in a uniform gravitational field and circular motion.</p>

                    <p>Electromagnetism is a theory that considers electric and magnetic fields and allows us to understand the properties of charged particles and the characteristics of electromagnetic waves and light. Unlike other branches of physics, electromagnetism is considered to be an almost complete theory. Electric and magnetic fields follow four equations called Maxwell's equations. It uses more difficult mathematics than classical mechanics, but it is a very beautiful science. If you study electromagnetism, you will be fascinated by the beauty of electromagnetism.</p>

                    <p>Quantum mechanics is a discipline that allows us to analyse the motion of particles at a very small level, such as the atoms that make up us. When we say particles, they may not be the tiny grains you might imagine. This is because particles are also thought to have properties as waves. An electron, for example, is both a particle and a wave. The most famous equation in quantum mechanics is the Schrodinger equation. If we can solve it, we can find out the probability of the existence of a particle. Schrodinger is best known for Schrodinger's cat. In fact, there is a man called Heisenberg who created a different form of quantum mechanics to Schrodinger's. In physics, the Heisenberg form of matrix mechanics is very often used.</p>
